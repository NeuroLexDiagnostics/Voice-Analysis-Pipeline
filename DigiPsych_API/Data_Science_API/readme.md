# Data_Science_API

In order to utilize this API, please make sure you are in a Python3 Environment.

Please make sure to have the following packages installed:
- seaborn
- sklearn

Direction:
- provide a path to a csv file
- non-numeric features and incomplete columns will be removed 

## How to use:
run prompt.py 

### Obtaining data set:
```
Begin Operation... 
Notice: Non-numeric data besides the target class (can be categorical) will be ignored... 
Please provide a path to a csv file: D:\\MHA_Data\subdata.csv
```

### Encode target class:
```
Please provide the name of the target class: Severity
Your target class is not numerical. Transforming it to categorical...
Here is a list of unique values (size: 5): 
['Moderately Severe Depression', 'Severe Depression', 'Moderate Depression', 'Minimal Depression', 'Mild Depression']
Please provide an numeric encoding separated by space in the same order: 4 5 3 1 2
Here is the mapping according to the encoding you provide: 
{'Severity': {'Moderately Severe Depression': '4', 'Severe Depression': '5', 'Moderate Depression': '3', 'Minimal Depression': '1', 'Mild Depression': '2'}}
```

### Data Visualization:
1. Correlation Plot
2. Pair-wise Grid Plot
3. Violin Plot
4. Heat Map of Correlation

Heat map (limitation: with large dataset, only plot first 20 features)
```
Non-numeric columns and columns with missing values removed.
Data Normalized (z-score).
Would you like to (continue) visualize your data? (y/n) y
Here is a list of method to choose: 
1. Correlation Plot Between Two Features
2. Pair-wise Grid Plot Among 3+ Features (no more than 6)
3. Violin Plot Between Features and the Target Class
4. Heat Map of Correlation Between Every Pair of Features
Please choose a method by number 1 - 4: 4

3. lasso select from model (lasso)
4. use top 2 classifiers above to select from model (optimal_classifer)
