Problem with Feature_Selection_API

feel free to try this api and leave comments below the dot line 
------------------------------------------------------------------




1. lasso selectFromModel 
- get empty sets (no features pass threshold)
- only remains PHQ9_Score
2. RFECV
- RFECV learning curve plot don't have standard deviation shade
3. data visualization
- cannot handle large datasets (plot memory, size of figure)
- can only plot part of dataset at once 
4. efficiency
- getBestK slow with advanced classifier (exhausive search?)
5. overfitting, underfitting
- heavy overfitting issue (potential reason: limitation of features, model?)
