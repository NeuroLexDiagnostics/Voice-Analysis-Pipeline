# DigiPsych Voice Analysis Pipeline

The DigiPsych Voice Analysis Pipeline was created to enable easy extraction of features for voice computing technologies. From the features extracted, users can model affective mood, neurodegenerative diseases, among a wide array of applications (ie: diagnosing colds, presence of caffeine, medication, etc.). The DigiPsych Voice Analysis Pipeline is the amalgamation of work performed by students in the UW DigiPsych Lab (http://www.rezahosseinighomi.com/)

The DigiPsych Voice Analysis pipeline also contains an in-house analysis pipeline that users can use to quickly model their data (https://github.com/larryzhang95/Voice-Analysis-Pipeline/tree/master/DigiPsych_API/Data_Science_API).

#### Acknowledgements:
We would like to thank Neurolex Diagnostics for assisting in developing the basis for this work. 

We also have an associated paper with this pipeline submitted to Interspeech 2019, and plan to continue adding features. If you would like to request a feature to be added, please file an issue, and corresponding papers/sources which our collaborators and students may be able to implement
