# DigiPsych API

The following repository is the current vision of the Feature Extraction, Data Analysis, and Visualization for the DigiPsych API.

The API supports Machine Learning Modelling (ML_API.py), Feature Extraction (Feat_API_vPY3.py), and Visualization(DATA_VIZ.py)

### Prerequisite Modules

### Using Feature Extraction

return features in CSV form.

### Using Machine Learning API
